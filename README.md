Monitor Process Execution

This powershell script monitors process execution on windows systems and submits the hash/file to virustotal for analysis.  It also logs all executions and maintains a whitelist and an ignore list to avoid re-submitting.

Ideally meant to be deployed on all LAN computers to the greatest visibility.
